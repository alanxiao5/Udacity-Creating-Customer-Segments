Udacity Identify Customer Segments

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.

## Description

This is the third project of Udacity Machine Learning with Tensorflow. In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.

The data was provided by Udacity partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics.
